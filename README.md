Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe
In this project you will modify the code that you worked on in the previous CS course to do three things:

Allows two players to play against each other.
Utilizes object oriented programming, making a Tic-Tac-Toe class with functions.
Adds other improvements to make the program more user friendly.
